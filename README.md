#IRC Bots

**:octocat: IRC Bots** is a simple to use/edit bit of JavaScript code built using the [Node IRC](http://node-irc.readthedocs.org) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) libraries. The bot welcomes each member to the IRC room and replies to a particular set of "trigger" words. The bot can be found in the IRC channel, [#supersecretroom](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.kiwiirc.com/#supersecretroom).
